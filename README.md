# Machine-Learning-Classification-Hands-On-CKD
# üß† Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction using Classification Algorithms

This project builds and compares multiple machine learning classification models to predict whether a patient has **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**, using a given dataset from a hospital.
